## üîê Keylogger (Linux, evdev-based)

A basic keylogger using the `evdev` library to capture keyboard inputs on Linux systems. Works on X11 and Wayland with root access.

### Features
- Logs key presses from physical keyboard
- Saves to a log file with optional timestamps
- Linux-only (requires `/dev/input` access)


## üì° Network Anomaly Detection

A lightweight Python-based tool to capture live packets and detect low-level network anomalies like:
- Unusual traffic volume
- Suspicious ports and protocols
- ARP spoofing / MAC flooding

üéØ Designed for cross-platform use, with future potential for IoT deployment.
